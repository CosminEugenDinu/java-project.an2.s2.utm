# Project Requirements â€“ MAP Sem 2 / 2022

## Each student will work on an individual or in a team. In order for a project to be graded, it must:

- not have compilation errors
- implement all requirements
- provide .zip file with the complete solution

## Timeline:

- Submit project (zip and documentation) by May - end of day
  Project will be submitted via Teams , via email.

## Assignment definition

Select a system to be implemented that allows at least 10 actions/queries to be performed on at least 8 types of objects.

## Implementation

Implement a project using the Java language.

## The application will:

- include simple classes with private/protected attributes and methods
- include abstract classes and interfaces with default behaviour
- follow OOP principles while defining the classes and their interaction
- include at least 2 different collection interfaces, each with multiple implementations (e.g. at least 2 List implementations, at list 2 Map implementations etc.), capable of administering the objects in the application
- use inheritance and polymorphism for some of the classes used within the collections
- at least one service class that exposes the system's operations
- a main class that calls the service's methods
- define custom Exceptions and use them to make decisions
- use Enums

## Storage

- CSV files will be used to store at least 4 types of objects. Each column in the file is separated with a comma. Example: name,surname,age or use data bases
- Generic singleton services will be created for reading and writing from/to files
  o At system startup, the data will be automatically loaded from the files.

## Auditing

An auditing service will need to be created that will log to a CSV file each time an action defined in the service is performed. Structure of the file: name_of_action,timestamp.
